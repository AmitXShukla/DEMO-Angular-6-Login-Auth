                about individuals, including but not limited to our customers and employees. In many cases that information
                includes individuals' Social Security numbers. We use records of Social Security numbers for many purposes,
                especially to comply with federal and state laws such as tax laws and anti-money-laundering laws. Our policy
                is (i) to comply with all laws restricting the use and disclosure of Social Security numbers, (ii) to protect
                the confidentiality of Social Security numbers, (iii) to prohibit the unlawful disclosure of Social Security
                numbers, and (iv) to limit access to Social Security numbers to our employees, and in certain cases to nonaffiliated
                parties that provide services to us, based on their responsibilities. To safeguard Social Security numbers,
                we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with applicable legal
                standards. Our employees are prohibited from disclosing Social Security numbers for unauthorized purposes.
                We may share Social Security numbers among our affiliated companies or with nonaffiliated parties for administrative
                purposes, such as to process transactions, verify identities, and service accounts. We disclose Social Security
                numbers as required or permitted by law, such as to the Internal Revenue Service or to credit bureaus. When
                necessary, we disclose Social Security numbers to regulatory agencies, law enforcement agencies, courts,
                and parties to lawsuits. We may share Social Security numbers among our affiliated companies for marketing
                purposes, but only in compliance with legal restrictions, including required opportunities to opt out of
                such sharing. We do not, without consent of the individual involved, share Social Security numbers with parties
                not affiliated with us to enable them to market their own products or services.

                11 attacks, President Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act into law on October 26, 2001. This landmark legislation
                calls for a major expansion of U.S. anti-money laundering compliance as well as anti-terrorism compliance
                obligations for all U.S. financial institutions. Pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act and final rules issued by
                the U.S. Treasury Department, financial institutions operating in the United States are required to obtain
                certain information from any "Foreign Bank" that maintains a correspondent account with it in the U.S. Under
                the final rules, this information is collected through a certification process. To comply with these obligations,
                each of The Elish Consulting foreign branches and banking entities listed in the attachment hereto has completed
                the attached Global Certification for use by any U.S. financial institution that requires a USA PATRIOT Act
                Certification from any such The Elish Consulting foreign branch or entity. Please use this Certification
                instead of asking an individual The Elish Consulting foreign branch or entity to complete a separate Certification:
